## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 0: Data Validation (CRITICAL)

**Function Call:** `FinancialAnalysisPlugin.ValidateBalanceSheetEquation(totalAssets, totalLiabilities, totalEquity)`

**Validation:**
```
Check: Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity

If invalid:
  STOP ANALYSIS
  Investigate data quality
  Fix data source
  Restart analysis
```

**Example (Acme Corp):**
```
Assets:              $1,000,000
Liabilities:         $  550,000
Equity:              $  450,000
Sum (L + E):         $1,000,000

Check: $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 ✅ VALID

Proceed to foundation skills
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Invalid = Accounting error (likely data quality issue)
- Invalid = Can't trust the numbers
- Must fix before proceeding
- Common causes:
  - Manual data entry errors
  - System export issues
  - Adjustments not posted
  - Consolidated accounting issues

---

### Step 1: Run Liquidity Skill

**Function Call:** `FinancialAnalysisPlugin.CalculateCurrentRatio(...), CalculateQuickRatio(...), CalculateWorkingCapital(...)`

**Input:** Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Inventory

**Output: Liquidity Profile**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Current Ratio | 1.79 | ✅ Healthy |
| Quick Ratio | 1.14 | ✅ Healthy |
| Working Capital | $110,000 | ✅ Good cushion |
| **Liquidity Rating** | | **STRONG ✅** |

**Interpretation in Dashboard Context:**
- Can company meet short-term obligations? **YES**
- Is there immediate risk? **NO**
- Proceed with confidence to longer-term analysis

**Red Flags at This Stage:**
- Current Ratio < 1.0 = Can't cover obligations
- Quick Ratio < 0.5 = Inventory dependency critical
- Working Capital negative = Deficit position
→ If any red flag: Investigate immediately before proceeding

---

### Step 2: Run Capital Structure Skill

**Function Call:** `FinancialAnalysisPlugin.CalculateDebtToEquityRatio(...), CalculateDebtToAssetsRatio(...), CalculateEquityMultiplier(...), EquityToTotalAssetsPercentage(...)`

**Input:** Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Total Equity, Debt

**Output: Leverage Profile**

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| D/E Ratio | 1.0 | 0.5-0.8 | 🟡 Above peers |
| D/A Ratio | 40% | 30-35% | 🟡 Above peers |
| Equity Multiplier | 2.5x | 1.8-2.0x | 🟡 Elevated |
| Equity % | 45% | 55-60% | 🟡 Below peers |
| **Leverage Rating** | | | **BALANCED 🟡** |

**Interpretation in Dashboard Context:**
- Is company at financial risk? **Not yet, but elevated**
- How much borrowing capacity? **Limited**
- Sensitivity to downturn? **Moderate - more affected than peers**

**Connection to Liquidity:**
- Strong liquidity + Elevated leverage = Can service debt currently
- But elevated leverage + weak liquidity = Problem
- In this case: Strong position despite leverage ✅

**Red Flags at This Stage:**
- D/E > 2.5 = High leverage
- D/A > 60% = Creditor-heavy structure
- Equity < 30% = Thin equity cushion
- Rising trend = Deteriorating position

---

### Step 3: Run Period Change Skill

**Function Call:** `FinancialAnalysisPlugin.CalculateAbsoluteChange(...), CalculatePercentageChange(...), CalculatePercentagePointChange(...)`

**Input:** Current Period Values, Prior Period Values (all line items)

**Output: Trend Profile**

| Metric | Absolute | % Change | pp Change | Trend |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Revenue | +$75,000 | +15% | N/A | ↗ Strong |
| COGS | +$45,000 | +15% | 0 pp | ↗ Proportional |
| Net Income | +$9,000 | +15% | 0 pp | ↗ Proportional |
| D/E Ratio | 0.0 | 0% | N/A | → Stable |
| **Trend Rating** | | | | **POSITIVE ✅** |

**Interpretation in Dashboard Context:**
- Is business growing? **YES - solidly**
- Sustainable growth? **YES - balanced**
- Improving or deteriorating? **Improving**
- Direction for future? **Positive**

**Connection to Other Metrics:**
- Growth + stable leverage = Financial position strengthening
- Growth + rising leverage = Need to monitor
- Decline + rising leverage = Major warning
- In this case: Positive trajectory ✅

**Red Flags at This Stage:**
- Revenue declining but expenses rising
- Margins compressing (pp changes negative)
- Leverage rising while profitability declining
- Cash position worsening despite revenue growth

---

### Step 4: Run Common-Size Skill

**Function Call:** `FinancialAnalysisPlugin.CalculateCommonSizePercentage(...), CommonSizeBalanceSheetAssets(...), CommonSizeBalanceSheetLiabilities(...), EquityToTotalAssetsPercentage(...)`

**Input:** All Balance Sheet items

**Output: Composition Profile**

| Item | % of Total | Benchmark | Assessment |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Current Assets | 30% | 25-35% | ✅ In range |
| Fixed Assets | 50% | 50-65% | ✅ In range |
| Current Liab | 20% | 15-25% | ✅ In range |
| LT Debt | 30% | 20-35% | ✅ In range |
| Equity | 45% | 45-65% | ✅ In range |
| **Structure Rating** | | | **TYPICAL ✅** |

**Interpretation in Dashboard Context:**
- Is company structured like peers? **YES**
- Any unusual composition? **NO**
- Red flags in structure? **NONE**

**Connection to Other Metrics:**
- Typical structure + strong liquidity = Good financial position
- Typical structure + weak liquidity = Liquidity is the issue (not structure)
- Unusual structure + weakness = Structure and composition issues
- In this case: Typical structure, strong fundamentals ✅

**Red Flags at This Stage:**
- 40%+ in "Other" assets (what are they?)
- Intangibles > 30% (goodwill impairment risk)
- Current Liab > 50% (maturity mismatch)
- Extreme deviation from peer structure

RISK ASSESSMENT
───────────────

Financial Distress Probability:
  Immediate (0-12 months):     LOW
  Medium-term (1-3 years):     LOW-MODERATE
  Long-term (3+ years):        MODERATE

Stress Test - Recession Scenario:
  If revenue declined 20%:
    ├─ Current Ratio would decline to: 1.35 (still healthy)
    ├─ D/E would increase to: 1.25 (manageable)
    └─ Risk: Would need to reduce costs or seek financing

Stress Test - Rising Rates Scenario:
  If interest rates up 2%:
    ├─ Additional interest expense: ~$8,000 annually
    ├─ Impact on net income: -12% (minor)
    └─ Risk: Moderate - limited impact


KEY STRENGTHS
─────────────
1. ✅ Strong liquidity position - can weather short-term challenges
2. ✅ Stable and improving profitability
3. ✅ Balanced growth with margin stability
4. ✅ Typical industry structure - aligned with peers
5. ✅ Valid balance sheet - clean data


AREAS OF CONCERN
────────────────
1. 🟡 Above-average leverage vs. peers (D/E 1.0 vs 0.6)
2. 🟡 Limited debt capacity - already leveraged
3. 🟡 Sensitivity to economic downturn elevated
4. 🟡 Interest rate exposure (30% LT Debt)


RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
───────────────────

Short-term (0-3 months):
  □ Continue monitoring liquidity (current position healthy)
  □ Track receivables and inventory (working capital management)
  □ Monitor revenue/margin trends (continue positive trajectory)

Medium-term (3-12 months):
  □ Develop debt reduction plan (bring D/E to peer average 0.7)
  □ Evaluate capital allocation:
    ├─ Reduce debt? (strengthen balance sheet)
    ├─ Invest in growth? (use strong cash generation)
    └─ Return capital? (unlikely given elevation targets)
  □ Assess interest rate hedging (if material debt exposure)

Long-term (12+ months):
  □ Strategic financing review (target D/E of 0.7)
  □ Capital structure optimization
  □ Industry monitoring (are peers changing leverage?)


STAKEHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS
────────────────────────────

For Lenders:
  ✅ Approve credit within normal parameters
  ✅ Monitor leverage ratio as covenant
  ⚠️  Note above-average leverage vs. peers
  Recommendation: APPROVE with elevated leverage covenant


For Equity Investors:
  ✅ Solid financial position
  ✅ Strong growth trajectory
  ✅ Reasonable risk/reward
  ⚠️  Limited debt capacity (constrains growth capex)
  Recommendation: BUY with moderate conviction


For Company Management:
  ✅ Strong operational performance
  ✅ Continue revenue growth strategy
  ⚠️  Prioritize debt reduction when opportunities arise
  Recommendation: Maintain course, target debt reduction

Here\u0027s what it does:\n\n**How it works:**\n- Uses **3 parallel AI solvers** (Claude, GPT, and Gemini) to tackle the same math problem\n- Each solver works independently to find a solution\n- A **verifier** then checks and compares the results from all three solvers\n- Provides a consensus-based answer that\u0027s more reliable than a single solver\n\n**Input:** Takes a math problem (as text or can be null)\n\n**Use case:** Best for complex mathematical problems where you want multiple approaches and verification to ensure accuracy\n\nWant me to demonstrate it with a math problem?"

/**

 *
 * Branches do NOT have stable IDs (only leaves do). This is an intentional simplification:
 *
 * ✅ Why: Branches are ephemeral—created/destroyed during tree restructuring (add, remove, split).
 *    Giving them IDs would complicate serialization and identity tracking with no clear benefit.
 *
 * ✅ Trade-off: Simpler mental model—only leaves are addressable units. Branches are
 *    organizational structure, not user-facing panels.
 *
 * ⚠️ Future consideration: If you later need branch-level operations (targeted logging,
 *    branch-scoped persistence, branch-level instrumentation), add `id?: string` to
 *    BranchNode and update serialization. This is a non-breaking change.

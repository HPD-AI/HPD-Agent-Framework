| Account Group | 2024 | 2023 | Change (pp) |
|---------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Current Assets / Total Assets** | 68.67% | 73.39% | -4.72 |
| **Non-Current Assets / Total Assets** | 31.33% | 26.61% | +4.72 |

| **Stockholders' Equity / Total Capital** | 42.58% | 54.49% | -11.91 |

### Calculation Proof:

**2024 Calculations:**
- Current Assets: $10,583 ÷ $15,410 = 68.67%
- Non-Current Assets: $4,827 ÷ $15,410 = 31.33%
- Current Liabilities: $2,251 ÷ $8,848 = 25.44%
- Non-Current Liabilities: $6,597 ÷ $8,848 = 74.56%
- Stockholders' Equity: $6,562 ÷ $15,410 = 42.58%

**2023 Calculations:**
- Current Assets: $12,313 ÷ $16,778 = 73.39%
- Non-Current Assets: $4,465 ÷ $16,778 = 26.61%
- Current Liabilities: $2,487 ÷ $7,637 = 32.56%
- Non-Current Liabilities: $5,150 ÷ $7,637 = 67.44%
- Stockholders' Equity: $9,141 ÷ $16,778 = 54.49%

## Question 12: Major Changes Analysis

### Three Most Significant Changes:

**1. Stockholders' Equity Decline (-11.91 percentage points)**
- **Change:** From 54.49% to 42.58% of total capital structure
- **Primary Driver:** Expansion of accumulated deficit due to continued net losses
- **Context:** Rivian's substantial cash burn during scaling phase, with 2024 net loss contributing to accumulated deficit growth

**2. Current Assets Reduction (-4.72 percentage points)**
- **Change:** From 73.39% to 68.67% of total assets
- **Primary Driver:** Decrease in cash and cash equivalents as capital deployed to operations
- **Context:** Cash utilization for manufacturing expansion, inventory building, and operational expenses

**3. Non-Current Liabilities Increase (+7.12 percentage points)**
- **Change:** From 67.44% to 74.56% of total liabilities
- **Primary Driver:** Growth in other non-current liabilities, including deferred revenues
- **Context:** Strategic partnerships (Volkswagen) and advance customer payments creating long-term obligations

### Analysis Paragraph:

Three balance sheet groups changed most significantly from 2023 to 2024. First, **stockholders' equity decreased from 54.49% to 42.58% of total capital structure** (an 11.91 percentage point decline), driven primarily by the company's accumulated deficit expanding due to continued net losses as Rivian invests heavily in scaling production and R&D as a growth-stage EV manufacturer. Second, **current assets declined from 73.39% to 68.67% of total assets** (a 4.72 percentage point decrease), with the primary driver being a significant reduction in cash and cash equivalents as the company deployed capital toward manufacturing expansion, inventory building, and operational expenses during its critical scaling phase. Third, **non-current liabilities increased from 67.44% to 74.56% of total liabilities** (a 7.12 percentage point increase), primarily driven by other non-current liabilities rising substantially, which includes deferred revenues related to strategic partnerships like the Volkswagen collaboration and advance payments from commercial customers. These changes collectively reflect Rivian's transition from a heavily cash-funded startup to a capital-intensive manufacturing operation requiring substantial long-term financing while burning through cash reserves during the critical scaling phase.

### Key Business Insights:
1. **Capital Structure Shift:** Moving from equity-heavy to more debt-dependent financing
2. **Liquidity Management:** Active deployment of cash balance for growth initiatives
3. **Strategic Partnerships:** Long-term obligations increasing through collaboration agreements
4. **Growth Phase Characteristics:** Typical patterns for scaling EV manufacturers requiring substantial capital investment

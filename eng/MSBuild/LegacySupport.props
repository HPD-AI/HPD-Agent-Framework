    LegacySupport.props - Polyfill Injection Rules

    This file is a placeholder for future legacy support.
    When EnableLegacySupport is set to 'true' in Directory.Build.props,
    this file will inject polyfills for older frameworks.

    See InternalDocs/HPD.Agent/Proposals/Compatibility/03-LegacySupportProps.md
    for the full implementation when needed.

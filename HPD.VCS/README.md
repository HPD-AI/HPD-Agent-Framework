## Usage Examples

### Creating and Working with Object IDs

```csharp
using VCS.Core;

// Create object IDs from content
var content = "Hello, VCS!"u8.ToArray();
var commitId = ObjectIdFactory.CreateCommitId(content);
var treeId = ObjectIdFactory.CreateTreeId(content);

// Convert to hex representation
string hex = commitId.ToHexString();
string shortHex = commitId.ToShortHexString(); // First 12 characters

// Parse from hex string
var parsed = ObjectIdBase.FromHexString<CommitId>(hex);
```

### Working with Repository Paths

```csharp
// Create paths
var path = new RepoPath("src", "main", "Program.cs");
var rootPath = RepoPath.Root;

// Path operations
var parent = path.Parent();           // "src/main"
var filename = path.FileName();       // "Program.cs"
var joined = parent.Join("App.cs");   // "src/main/App.cs"

// Path relationships
bool isAncestor = parent.IsAncestorOf(path);    // true
bool startsWith = path.StartsWith(parent);      // true
```

### Creating Version Control Objects

```csharp
// Create file content
var fileData = new FileContentData("console.log('Hello, World!');"u8.ToArray());
var fileId = ObjectHasher.ComputeFileContentId(fileData);

// Create tree entry
var entry = new TreeEntry(
    new RepoPathComponent("app.js"), 
    TreeEntryType.File, 
    new ObjectIdBase(fileId.HashValue.ToArray())
);

// Create tree
var tree = new TreeData(new[] { entry });
var treeId = ObjectHasher.ComputeTreeId(tree);

// Create commit
var author = new Signature("Developer", "dev@example.com", DateTimeOffset.Now);
var commit = new CommitData(
    parentIds: Array.Empty<CommitId>(),
    rootTreeId: treeId,
    associatedChangeId: ObjectIdFactory.CreateChangeId("change-1"u8.ToArray()),
    description: "Initial commit",
    author: author,
    committer: author
);
